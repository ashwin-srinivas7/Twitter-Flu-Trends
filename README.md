### Using Twitter to detect Flu Trends in the US

In this project, we extract Tweets pertaining to Influenza to detect trends in Flu. 
Using these tweets, we map out the areas within the continental USA which have higher number of mentions of flu related topics. We then compare this to the actual flu map of the CDC to find trends in Flu.
